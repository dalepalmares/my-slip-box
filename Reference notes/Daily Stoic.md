### April 27 - Turn It Inside Out
```ad-quote
title: Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 8.21
collapse: open

Turn it inside out and see it is like ─ what it becomes like when old, sick, or prostituting itself. How short-lived the praiser and the praised, the one who remembers and the remembered. Remembered in some corner of these parts, and even there not in the same way by all, or even by one. And the whole earth is but a mere speck.

Stoicism is about looking at things from every angle ─ and certain situations are easier to understand from different perspectives. In potentially negative situations, the objective, even superficial gaze might actually be superior. That view might let us see things clearly without diving too much into what they might represent or what might have caused them. In other situations, particularly those that involve something impressive or praiseworthy, another approach, like that of contemptuous expressions, is helpful. By examining situations from the inside out, we can be less daunted by them, less likely to be swayed by them.
Dig into your fear of death or obscurity, and what will you find? Turn some fancy ceremony inside out and you'll find ─ what?

### April 28 -  Wants Make You A Servant
```ad-quote
title: Seneca, Thyestes, 440

Tantalus: The highest power is ─
Tyestes: No power, if you desire nothing.
```
In the modern world, our interactions with tyranny are a bit more voluntary than they were in ancient times. We put up with our controlling boss, though we could probably get a different job if we wanted. We change how we dress or refrain from saying what we actually think? Because we want to fit in with some cool group. We put up with cruel critics or customers? Because we want their approval. In these cases, their power exists because of our wants. You change that, and you're free.
The late fashion photographer Bill Cunningham occasionally declined to invoice magazines for his work. When a young upstart asked him why that was, Cunningham's response was epic: "If you don't take money, they can't tell you what to do, kid."
Remember: taking the money, wanting the money ─ proverbially or literally ─ makes you a servant to the people who have it. Indifference to it, as Seneca put it, turns the highest power into no power, at least as far as your life is concerned.
### May 2 - Be The Person You Want To Be
```ad-quote
title: Epictetus, Discourses, 3.23.1-2a
collapse: open

First tell yourself what kind of person you want to be, then do what you have to do. For in nearly every pursuit we see this to be the case. Those in athletic pursuit first choose the sport they want, and then do that work.

An archer is highly unlikely to hit a target she did not aim for. The same goes for you, whatever your target. You are certain to miss the target if you don't bother to draw back and fire. Our perceptions and principles guide us in the selection of what we want ─ but ultimately our actions determine whether we get there or not.
So yes, spend some time ─ real, uninterrupted time ─ thinking about what's important to you, what your priorities are. Then, work toward that and forsake all the others. It's not enough to wish and hope. One must act ─ and act right.
### May 12 - Kindness Is Always The Right Response
```ad-quote
title: Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 11.18.5.9a
collapse: open

Kindness is invincible, but only when it's sincere, with no hypocrisy or faking. For what can even the most malicious person do if you keep showing kindness and, if given the chance, you gently point out where they went wrong ─ right as they are trying to harm you?

```
What if the next time you were treated meanly, you didn't just restrain yourself from fighting back ─ what if you responded with unmitigated kindness? What if you could "love your enemies, do good to those who hate you?" What kind of effect do you think that would have?
The Bible says that when you can do something nice and caring to a hateful enemy, it is like "heap(ing) burning coals on his head." The expected reaction to hatred is more hatred. When someone says something pointed or mean today, they expect you to respond in kind ─ not with *kindness*. When that doesn't happen, they are embarrassed. It's a shock to their system ─ it makes them and you better.
Most rudeness, meanness, and cruelty are a mask for deep-seated weakness. Kindness in these situations is only possible for people of great strength. You have that strength. Use it.
