# What to do with your money
Life is meant to be enjoyed, so don't be a stringent mfer with your money, it is totally fine to spend on things you actually enjoy, just make sure that what you're spending your money on is worthwhile.

But remember, only do that after you've put aside a portion of your income into savings.
